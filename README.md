## Description
This application is used to create the bacckend architecture of an ecommercce website, enabling the user to create various API endpoints that store information between pages. As a part of this, I utilized Node.js, SQL and Object Relational Mapping to create various routes. By doing this, I was able to learn how to create new endpoints. This also uses MySQL2 and Sequelize technologies.
